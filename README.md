Community-Driven Insurance : Where Community Shapes Insurance

## ⛓️ The Problem it Solves <a id = "problem"></a>

1. Assist those in need:
    - Provide financial assistance to those who cannot afford insurance.

2. Eliminating Manual Verification:<br />
    desc

3. Increased Trust and Transparency:
    - Community-driven insurance encourages trust and transparency among members.

## 🚀 Challenges we ran into <a id = "challenges"></a>

In our endeavor to create something truly groundbreaking, we intend to explore the synergies between smart contracts and machine learning algorithms. By leveraging the inherent flexibility of smart contracts and the predictive capabilities of machine learning, we aim to develop an adaptive system that can autonomously respond to dynamic conditions and make intelligent decisions in real-time.

This project represents a significant leap forward in the realm of decentralized applications, enabling smart contracts to evolve and adapt based on real-world data and user interactions. By incorporating machine learning support, our solution will not only enhance the efficiency and reliability of smart contracts but also introduce a new paradigm in decentralized applications.
